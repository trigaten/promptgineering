## Features

1. Quickly iterate on your prompts in a collaborative playground that supports all the major providers, variables, automatic versioning, and more.
2. Confidently ship by evaluating your prompts with a suite of evals like context recall, llm-rubric (LLM as a judge), latency, and more. Let us handle intelligent caching and complex implementations to save you time and money.
3. Easily build datasets from real data using Logs, upload your own as a CSV, or collaboratively build and edit within your Adaline workspace.
4. Continuously evaluate your completions in production, see how your users are using your prompts, and create datasets by sending logs using our APIs.
5. Easily rollbacks if your performance regresses in production, see how your team iterated the prompt, or just know that we automatically version your prompts to avoid any data loss.
